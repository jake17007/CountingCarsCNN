Training a deep convolutional neural network to count the number of cars in an image of a parking lot.

See `cnn_cc-k-c_AllImages_01.py` for the best CNN so far.

See this [page](http://jacobbeauchamp.com/computerVision.html) for documentation of this project.

See this [paper](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/280_Report.pdf) for info about the CNN archictecture, dataset, and counting *empty spaces*.

See this [paper](http://www.inf.ufpr.br/lesoliveira/download/pklot-readme.pdf) for info about the dataset, specifically.
